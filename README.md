 <a href="https://abhiuday3141-stocksuggestionsystem-stockapphome-dnqybx.streamlitapp.com/Stacked_LSTM">Demo<a>


In This Project I have build A stocks Suggestion system which gives you the best stock to buy on a given date out of 3 bank stocks namely Citi bank, JPMorgan and Morgan stanley

## Steps involved
1) Data set is obtained from yahoo finance 
2) Data prepared to give to the Stacked LSTM model
3) Performed search for appropriate timestep to minimise error
4) Predict future values
5) Save the future files in csv files to obtain for later use
7) Advice The user to buy the stock that offers greatest amount of return
8) The suggestion can be customised according to user-needs such as amount investing and number of stocks.

I have also hosted the demo App for giving a overview of how it works

Now It also has an BI-LSTM model for comparison with Stacked LSTM
